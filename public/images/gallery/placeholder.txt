This directory will contain gallery images.

In a production environment, these would be:
1. User-generated content that has been approved for the gallery
2. Featured examples created by the PetMoji team
3. Images from a curated API or partner service

For the MVP, you can add sample images here with the following naming convention:
- [pet-type][number]-original.jpg - For the original pet photo
- [pet-type][number]-[style].jpg - For the translated emotion image

Example:
- dog1-original.jpg
- dog1-cartoon.jpg
- cat1-original.jpg
- cat1-watercolor.jpg
